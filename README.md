## About

ðŸš€ Student and developer, I started programming at the age of 16, creating my own scripts in Python to automate my dad's job.

ðŸ“š I started college at 18 and got my first job as a developer at 21. Iâ€™m always looking to share the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained throughout this journey.

ðŸŽ“ I graduated in Digital Marketing at age 20, stepping out of the tech comfort zone, but bringing very relevant experiences for my growth in frontend development.

ðŸ§© Currently, Iâ€™m studying Computer Science at UFRR and working as a fullstack developer for both the Government of Roraima and DevOÌ¸ps, a business from MaranhÃ£o, always seeking to expand my knowledge and gain new experiences in the programming world.

ðŸ”Œ I've been really interested in embedded systems and electronics recently, mostly <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=arduino" height="28"/>.

I use <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vim" height="28"/> BTW.

## What am I Working on

### [FIPLAN API](https://github.com/CGPRE-SEPLAN-RR/fiplan-api)

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=go,java" height="28"/>

A RESTful API that facilites data retrieval from FIPLAN, the budgetary system for the state of Roraima. Primarily designed for generating BI reports and providing real-time information crucial for strategic decision-making.

I'm working as a solo developer for the API, while taking demands on the side to know which report to prioritize. This means I'm responsible for the architecture of the project and all of its features.

### [Stockee](https://stockee.vercel.app/login)

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,nodejs,express,postgres,supabase" height="28"/>

An intuitive tool tailored for construction companies, enabling seamless management of storage facilities.

I'm working as a backend developer for the system's lingering API and as one of the project managers that gives tasks as needed. I could be seen as the tech lead as well, since I'm the one that chooses the tech stack and discuss architectural decisions with my team.

### [Jabuti](https://github.com/Jabuti-Apps/jabuti)

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,django,postgres" height="28"/>

A fleet manager for the prefecture of Boa Vista that handles entrances and exits, maintenance and supply chain of vehicles.

I'm working as a fullstack developer and helping with design when requested.

### Redirect

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=go,sqlite" height="28"/>

A proxy solution that redirects users to either Telegram or WhatsApp chats, streamlining business communication.

I'm working as the main developer in the project, doing both frontend and backend work, while also passing tasks around to the team.

## What I'm learning

I'm writing a text editor following [this tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) with <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cmake" height="28"/>.

I'm also interested in <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,zig" height="28"/> and will probably build something with it soon.
